# Machine Learning Implementations

This repository consists of a set of notebooks, each implementing from scratch a common learning algorithm or related concept, and then evaluating the implementation on a benchmark dataset.

All data is located in the **data/** folder. Code shared between notebooks is stored in the **modules/** folder.
